Issues to consider:
Model Planning
Model Tab Structure
Model Flow

Major Issues/Key Drivers
- Identify Critical Assumptions that are hard to forecast 
- Identify Critical Assumptions that are hard for management to control
- Run a few Cases in the model (Base, Best, Worst etc..) 
- Key drivers are often Economic variables (Usually 2-6 Key drivers)

Economic variables:
- Commodity prices
- Inflation
- Exchange rates
- Interest rates

Assumptions
- All components of company.
- Ask good questions

Vertical orientation
- Limit number of sheets in the fille
- Most calculations in the forecast are on one sheet (schedules and the financial statement)
- Order: Cover-> Summary -> Assumptions -> Scenarios -> Model Sheet
- Model Sheet order: Revenue forecast-> Operating Cost-> Income statement-> Cashflow statement-> Balance Sheet

Horizontal orientation
- Each component is on its own sheet
- Usually each financial statement and each schedule is on its own sheet
- Order: Cover-> Summary -> Assumptions -> Scenarios -> Income statement-> Cashflow statement-> Balance Sheet->Revenue-> etc..

Hybrid Approach
- Cover, Summary, Assumptions, Scenarios, Financial Statements, All Schedules.

1) Model Planning:
1) Identify major issues and key drivers
2) Make a list of all Assumptions, with all the data provided or data needed to collect
3) What will the model look like on paper when finished (optimal model flow, optimal order to present the model)

2) Tab Structure:
- Vertical orientation
- Horizontal orientation
- Hybrid

3) Model Flow:
- Presenting the model (Optimal communication of the file)
- Recommended: Cover page-> Executive Summary -> Assumptions -> Scenarios-> Operating Schedules - Revenues and Costs -> Financial Statements 
-> Financial Schedules (Depreciation, Tax, Working Capital, Debt, Equity) -> Outputs Calculations (Ratios, Valuation: DCF,IRRS)
